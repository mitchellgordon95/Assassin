      <p> After everyone signs up, you will receive a target, whom you must "assassinate"</p>
      <p>The stress-reliever squirrels are your weapon. To assassinate your target, hit them with the squirrel.</p>
      <p>You can "stun" an attacker by hitting them with the squirrel. </p>
      <p>After a successful assassination, you get a new target. Last hacker standing wins.</p>
      <p>If you definitely can't find a person in the building, email mitchell@vandyhacks.org or ask an organizer to find Mitchell and he'll fix it.</p>
      <p>If you get hit at the "same time" as you hit your attacker, the attacker wins.</p>
